                    The award-winning game - SET challenges you to race
                    to find as many SETs as you can! A SET is three
                    cards where each individual feature - color, shape,
                    number and shading is either all the same OR all
                    different! When you see a SET click on the cards
                    and receive your SET and your score (5 points for each SET)!
                    If you want to switch one of your chosen cards, you can click
                    on it once more and choose another one instead. If there is no
                    SET on the table you can click the "Add 3 cards" button, and
                    you'll get 3 more cards! <br><br>
                    Good luck and enjoy yourself!!!
                </P>
